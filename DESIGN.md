"To Expectation"
Original Creation Date: ?
Plan sheet: 01/09/2026

# Layout
At most four players will be inside a off an "party" which they will be placed on a grid on the void. This grid will slowly expand over time, which places stress on the players as they need to hurry faster and faster to complete their "Tasks."

Tasks are given to player while meeting internal logic that balances out the difficulty across the players. This gets more unfair as chosen difficulty is changed:

Easy = 30,60,0
Medium = 0,60,30
Hard = 0,30,60

# World
The world starts off as a 1x1 hovering over the world, changing over time per round:
Round 1 = 3x3
Round 2 = 5x5
Break = 5x5
Final Stretch = 7x7

Each round will pass increasing the distance between things need for the next round's tasks.

# Mechanics
Sliding = Players can slide across surfaces (Might consider sloped parts of the map.)
Double jump = Players can double jump normally, sometimes this is removed per player given a "debuff" tasks.

# Loop
As per it's name the end goal is to do everything in time, or to the Lady's "expectation"

Each player shares the "World Timer" which is a clock and if it reaches a threshold, all players die instantly, ending the round. This timer IS affected sometimes by tasks, adding or subtracting time based on performance.

The Lady is a stand in place returning point for the players, and used as a indicator for world difficulty.

There are 4 different Ladies, each representing the increasing difficulty chosen at the start of the round:
Green = Easiest,
Red = Medium,
Purple = Hard,
Yellow = Harder (Certain conditions of spawning)

However, there's a 5th "Lady" of spawning, but must be done with a lobby with all Players having the Troll Badge and start a secret lobby. (Hold the launch button for more then 5 seconds.)

White = Hardest, very brutal.

Tasks are given out to which might become one of the following types:
- FETCH = Obtain a item and take it to Lady
- CRAFT = Obtain a item from a crafting source
- PACE = Reach a certain point on the map within a time limit
- ACTION = Taking an action (Emote, Dancing, Jumping 10 times) until finished.

# NPC's 
Bob = Bob is a middle man for obtaining other items in the game (That haven't appeared according to history) that can exchanged for with *very specific* items in certain amounts.

Maxwell = Has a 1/10000 chance every second of spawning random on the map, has no meaning. Just spins. 

Lady = Interacting with the Lady other for tasks has no meaning but provide the insight to the world's creation and some lore.

# Badges
"He killed you." = Die to Maxwell.
"I assume you got curious."

"Hot Potato" = Finish the Green Lady's tasks.

"Elegant Rose" = Finish the Red Lady's tasks.

"Light Reading" = Finish the Purple Lady tasks.

"Perfect Bee" = Finish the Yellow Lady's tasks.

"White World" = Finish the... Oh god.
